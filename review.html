                                <p>Epic Sci-Fi Trilogy followed up with a stand alone game.
                                    The original trilogy was very popular in its time. The first standalone game after 
                                    the original trilogy wasn't received as well as the original,
                                    but was still a solid game. No matter what, whether your a shooter or RPG fan,
                                    this series can rarely disappoint. 
                                    <br>

                                <p>A never ending role playing series with dozens of entries.
                                    The numbered series goes up to 15 at the time of this writing.
                                    However, many of those numbered entries have branched off into other games, and quite a few stand alone entries. 
                                    Not all final fantasy games are alike, and some are not as great as the others. So tough to score the entire series.

                                    Players fight zombies and various other mutants with limited resources. In 2019, the series made a very 
                                    strong comeback with remakes of the old games, even staying true to their roots.

                                    There is currently a total of 5 main titles, with a few spin offs. The last title was released in 2011
                                    and is still modded and played to this day. Excellent replayability, but few and far between
                                    when it comes to releases.
